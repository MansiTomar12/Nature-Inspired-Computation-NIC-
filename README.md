The bin-packing problem (BPP) involves n items, each weighing a different amount, that must be placed
in one of b bins. The task is to find a way of placing the items into the bins in such a way as to make the
total weight in each bin as nearly equal as possible. E.g,. if there are 6 items with weights as follows:
1=17kg, 2=12kg, 3=19kg, 4=6kg, 5=4kg and 6=28kg and they are placed into 3 bins as follows:
(bin1: 1, 3) (bin2: 4) (bin3: 2, 5, 6)
then bin1 has a weight of 36kg (17+19), bin2 has weight of 6kg, and bin3 has weight of 44kg (12+4+28).
The difference between these bins is large so it is a poor solution. The solution quality can be measured
by taking the difference d between the heaviest and lightest bins ‚Äì in this case d = 38. The task for the
evolutionary algorithm is to minimise this difference. A far better solution in this case is:
(bin1: 1, 2) (bin2: 3, 4, 5) (bin3: 6)
where d = 1.
There are a number of representations that could be used for this problem, but for this assignment
you should use the following k-ary representation. A chromosome (candidate solution to the
problem) is represented as a list of n numbers, where each number can be anything in the range from
1 to b. For example, the two candidate solutions above would be represented as 1 3 1 2 3 3 (where
item 1 is in bin 1, item 2 is in bin 3, item 3 is in bin 1 etc.) and 1 1 2 2 2 3. In the general case, if the ùëñth
number in the chromosome is b, then item number ùëñ is in bin b.
The fitness of a solution is worked out by calculating the difference d between the heaviest and
lightest bins. There are two specific bin-packing problems you should address. In each, there will be
500 items to be packed into a number of (b) bins (either 10 or 100). In problem BPP1, b = 10 and the
weight of item ùëñ (where ùëñ starts at 1 and finishes at 500) will be ùíä/ùüê. In problem BPP2, b = 100 and the
weight of item ùëñ will be ùíä
ùüê
/ùüê.
Hence, in the case of BPP1, a chromosome which starts:
3236‚Ä¶ etc‚Ä¶
indicates that item 1 (weight 1/2) is in bin 3, item 2 (weight 1) is in bin 2, item 3 (weight 3/2) joins item
1 in bin 3, item 4 (weight 2) is in bin 6, and so on.
The Evolutionary Algorithm
The evolutionary algorithm should be implemented as follows:
1. Generate an initial population of p randomly generated solutions, and evaluate the fitness of
every individual in the population.
2. Use binary tournament selection (with replacement) twice to select two parents a and b.
3. Run single-point crossover on these parents to give 2 children, c and d.
4. Run mutation on c and d to give two new solutions e and f. Evaluate the fitness of e and f.
5. Run weakest replacement, firstly for e, then f.
6. If a termination criterion has been reached, then stop. Otherwise return to step 2.
Termination Criterion: Will simply be having reached a maximum number of fitness evaluations, which
is 10,000 (see implementation and experimentation section below).
Binary Tournament Selection: Randomly choose a chromosome from the population; call it a.
Randomly choose another chromosome from the population; call this b. The fittest of these two
(breaking ties randomly) becomes the selected parent.
Single-Point Crossover: Randomly select a ‚Äòcrossover point‚Äô which should be smaller than the total
length of the chromosome. Take the two parents, and swap the gene values between them ONLY for
those genes which appear AFTER the crossover point to create two new children.
Multi-Gene Mutation: You should use the following parameterised mutation operator for this, Mk,
where k is an integer. The Mk operator simply repeats the following k times: choose a gene (locus) at
random, and change it to a random new value within the permissible range. Hence M1 changes just
one gene, while M15 might change 15 genes (maybe fewer than 15, because there is a chance that the
same gene might be chosen more than once).
Weakest Replacement: If the new solution is fitter than the worst in the population, then overwrite the
worst (breaking ties randomly) with the new solution.
Implementation and Experimentation
Implement the described EA in such a way that you can address the BPP problems, and then run the
following experiments and answer the subsequent questions. Note that, in all of the below, a single trial
means that you run the algorithm once and stop it when 10,000 fitness evaluations have been reached.
Different trials of the same algorithm should be seeded with different random number seeds.
Experiment 1: Run five trials of the EA with crossover & operator M1 and population size 10.
Experiment 2: Run five trials of the EA with crossover & operator M1 and population size 100.
Experiment 3: Run five trials of the EA with crossover & operator M5 and population size 10.
Experiment 4: Run five trials of the EA with crossover & operator M5 and population size 100.
Experiment 5: Run five trials of the EA with only operator M5 and population size 10.
Experiment 6: Run five trials of the EA with only crossover and population size 1
